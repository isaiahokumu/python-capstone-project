#  ðŸ©º Paediatric Clinical Assessment TOOL
A Python capstone project supervised by ~ Melody Bonareri

____________________________

### Project Description

This project is a digital tool that aims to provide real-time decision-making for on-ground diagnosis based on a triage workflow system. 

____________________________

### Problem solved
This is a **Streamlit-based web application** for real-time clinical assessment and disease surveillance, it is tailored for paediatric cases such as **Meningitis** and **Diarrhoea**. It integrates patient classification workflows, outbreak monitoring via web scraping, PDF/CSV report generation, emergency alerts, and analytics.
Guiding clinical workers to an interactive, user-friendly system that maximizes accurate diagnosis of the severity of a particular condition, recommending appropriate treatment plans, and focusing on disease forecasting to mitigate outbreaks and reduce mortality rates.

### Data Source

Manual creation
Ministry of health website [health.go.ke]
CDC website

____________________________

### Success Criteria

This program will allow the user to enter the patient's details, output them as initials for confidentiality, prompt the user on various symptoms, relay the severity of the disease, and provide appropriate treatment options.

I'll consider it a success if it handles at least 5 entries with anonymization of critical data information and appropriate error handling, if it can save data to the database and show outbreak alerts
