A python capstone project supervised by ~ Melody Bonareri

____________________________

### Project Description

This project is a digital tool that aims to provide real-time decision-making for on-ground diagnosis based on a triage workflow system. 

____________________________

### Problem solved
Guiding clinical workers to an interactive, user-friendly system that maximizes accurate diagnosis of the severity of a particular condition, recommending appropriate treatment plans and focusing on disease forecasting to mitigate outbreaks and reduce mortality rates.

____________________________

### Planned Features

- [ ] User input (e.g., patient name, symptom prompts, key press)
- [ ] Loops and conditionals
- [ ] Functions or classes
- [ ] File handling (`.db`, `.csv`)
- [ ] Simple GUI (Streamlit)
- [ ] Data tracking
- [ ] Restart/quit options

____________________________

### Concepts I Plan to Use 

> - Python core (functions, loops, dictionaries)  
> - Streamlit (for GUI)
> - Object Oriented Programming

____________________________

### Data Source

Manual creation

### Success Criteria

This program will allow the user to enter the patient's details, output them as initials for confidentiality, prompt the user on various symptoms, relay the severity of the disease, and provide appropriate treatment options.

I'll consider it a success if it handles at least 5 entries with anonymization of critical data information and appropriate error handling.
